This is my attempt to reconstruct Karyn Sutton's modeling in python work in a testable way

Code from Karyn is stashed in my OneDrive.

Dependencies:
dtk_genericindividual installed
dtk_nodedemog installed

This probably belongs in a GitHub repository.

Because of dependencies, might want to consider Docker as a solution / test environment.
To use Docker, need python modules available from artifactory (agnostic to DTKTrunk branch).

Before that, how can I test this?
Virtual environment, I'll copy install files into a folder called "fromDtkTrunk" and install from there.

Now I need to create a GitHub repo so that I can start backing things up.
C:\GitHub\modeling_in_python looks good.

git init is the command, but I'd rather have GitHub do this for me.
Going to https://github.com/CWiswell-IDM and looking for some kind of "make a new repo" button.

Repositories tab looks promising... there it is! the "New" button.
